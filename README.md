# BL_4WD_Gingerbread

This is modified version of android application for control of 
Simple RC car for beginners (Android control via Bluetooth) from

http://english.cxem.net/mcu/mcu2.php

I make required modifications and application is compiled for minSdkVersion="7" and targetSdkVersion="10"

I tested it on my Samsung GT-S 5690 and it works fine with button controls. When I try accelemeter control
it works with relative big delay, probably because off mass data sending and leak of phone hardware perfomance.
